Contributor Guidline 

More details are comming soon, this document will be updated regulary.

This guidlines set out guidlines for the behaviour within the community, and asked the contributors to approach participation with a specific mindset and lay out the actual process by which people can contribute to learningwikibase.

The contributor guidlines are for:

- potential contributors, people who want to know, what they can help out with, the process and the conversations you need to follow in making contributions, and the way how to interact with other community memembers
- project consumers as people who want to build on top of this project, remix, reuse it to create their own project
- project lead who creates and maintain this file 

#Projectvision# 

[Wikibase](wikiba.se) is an open source software suite for running a collaborative knowledge base. One installation of it is Wikidata. Wikibase enables humans and machines to work together productively in the same shared space. Wikibase is a collaborative knowledge base software that allows users to tie in to a vast network of linked open data, easily adding to and ingesting knowledge from Wikidata and other instances of Wikibase, creating an ecosystem of easily shared, accessible knowledge.

My motivation for this project is to provide clarity, transperency in the technical documentation of Wikibase in building a "place" where you can find all online learning ressources around wikibase. I hope that we can create more screencasts, wikibase training material or FAQ's together to make it possible for more people to use Wikibase as knowledge base for their data.

The vision of LearningWikibase is to provide Online Materials to make it easer to install, maintain or customize your Wikibase instance. Please share you're learnings or tipps with others to benefit from each other. 

#Projectlead#

My name is sandra I set up the project as part of Mozilla's Open Leadership program spring 2019. This is happening in my volunteer time. I work as project manager for Wikidata, Wikibase and other Wikimedia projects. I like to sail and to brew beer and cider. I'm happy that you found that repro and want to support the vision of learningwikibase. 

#Code of Conduct#

Below you can also find a Code of Conduct. Please read it and be aware of it.

#Ressources#

You can find more information about the project and plan in the Readme. The structure of Learning Wikibase is that we have different sections (articels) for every process step. So you can find: 

- Install Wikibase 
- Dataarchitecture
- Import Data
- Query & Export Data 
- Maintain Wikibase 
- Use Cases for Wikibase 

In every section we're collecting knowledge e.g. How-Tos, small Use Cases, Screencasts, FAQ's. I started with collecting information around Install Wikibase. You can find some information in all the other parts, but I hope that we can fill this together. There is already an existing Wikibase User-Group out there which already went through the whole process with high learning curves.

In the issue tracker you will find open issues for each section. 

#Communication Channel#

There is a Wikibase Telegram Group you can join by invite. For doing this please write me. There is also a @WikibaseLearning Twitter channel where I will post news, retweet ressources I found etc.

#Contributions#

You can contribute in three ways: 

- If you work on writing content (Technical Documentation Yah!) check out [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/) and our Style Guide
- If your contribution is minor e.g. such as a typo fix, a better phrase, a picture, a link etc. open a pull request.
- If your contribution is major e.g a new process step, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.

You can also report bugs e.g. design, conentent omissions or copy errors, which u thing could cause trouble for the project. This will be valuable feedback for the project.

Ground rules & expectations
Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely have different perspectives on "how open source is done." Try to listen to others rather than convince them that your way is correct.
Open Source Guides are released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution passes all tests. If there are test failures, you will need to address them before we can merge your contribution.
When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please don't add references or links to things you or your employer have created as others will do so if they appreciate it.
How to contribute
If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the issues and pull requests to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:

If your contribution is minor, such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
If your contribution is major, such as a new guide, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.
Style guide
If you're writing content, see the style guide to help your prose match the rest of the Guides.

Setting up your environment
This site is powered by Jekyll. Running it on your local machine requires a working Ruby installation with Bundler.

Once you have that set up, run:

script/bootstrap
script/server
â€¦and open http://localhost:4000 in your web browser.

Community
Discussions about the Open Source Guides take place on this repository's Issues and Pull Requests sections. Anybody is welcome to join these conversations. There is also a mailing list for regular updates.

Wherever possible, do not take these conversations to private channels, including contacting the maintainers directly. Keeping communication public means everybody can benefit and learn from the conversation.
