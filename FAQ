Coming from a linked data background, it would seem important to figure out how to link information between wikibases via common identifiers. They could be URLs, Q codes that are somehow coordinated to not overlap etc.

Do you have to learn sparql?
...take a look at http://www.wikigenomes.org .This tool relies fully on Wikidata and some wikibases
The users are not required to learn SPARQL the developers of Wikigenomes do

How you can provide the ease and accuracy of loading large amounts of data?
We are using the wikidata integrator for large scale imports in Wikidata and Wikibase: https://github.com/SuLab/WikidataIntegrator

What I was looking to improve was building an interactive UI for viewing bulk load results to make corrections easier.
Are you aware of Shape Expressoins? We are using this for this purpose: https://rawgit.com/shexSpec/shex.js/wikidata/doc/shex-simple.html?#
