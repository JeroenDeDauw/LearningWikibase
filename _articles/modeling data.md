# Linked Data
Wikibase is a software stack that allows storing linked data. Linked data is data that follows two principles. 
1. Data is available as [sematic triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple).
2. Data points use [Internationlized Resource Identifiers (IRI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier)

## Semantic triples
Core to link data is the concept of semantic triples. In relational databases, data is stored in tables. Spreadsheet also use a tabular structure to capture data. A semantic triple, however can be seen as a statement. 

The following record in tabular data
|book title|author|
|--|--|
| The origin of species | Charles Darwin  |
can also be described as the following semantic triple in linked data
