The joint initiative from [Abes](https://abes.fr/en/) and [BnF](https://www.bnf.fr/en) to build a new service to libaries and beyond (GLAMs) and a shared platform for collaboratively creating and maintaining reference data about entities (person, corporate bodies, places, concepts, creative works).

The two institutions have now agreed to jointly test the potential of Wikibase, the software used to run the free database Wikidata, for use in the largest authority file for cultural data in German-speaking countries, the Integrated Authority File (Gemeinsame Normdatei, GND). The significance of the evaluation project for the world of open data, the GLAM area and libraries, in particular, is described here., the software used to run the free database Wikidata, for use in the largest authority file for cultural data in German-speaking countries, the Integrated Authority File (Gemeinsame Normdatei, GND).
