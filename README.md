Welcome!
Thank you for joining Connecting-Wikibase. Wikibase (http://wikiba.se/) is the software behind Wikidata. Wikidata empowers Wikipedia and many other projects.
Both projects are technically developed by Wikimedia Deutschland e.V. (https://www.wikimedia.de/) and created and maintained by volunteers. 
The repro for Wikibase as software can be found here: https://github.com/wmde/wikibase-docker

This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the project. Jump straight to one of the sections below, or just scroll down to find out more.
My vision for this project is: I’m working with the Wikibase-community to make Wikibase more accessible to technical users so they can create their own open and collaborative database to serve their particular needs/goals.

#What are we doing?
The problem
*Technical Interaction with the Wikibase Software is challenging
*Wikibase as a Wikibase Database is used very individual. User’s have lot of different requirements. So there are a lot of different use cases
*Wikibase user can’t find enough developer support to get help in setting up a Wikibase Insance

A small group of early adopter Wikibase-enthusiasts is getting a lot of request by new users, who like to set up and test the Wikibase software. Some community
memebers already developed presentations, technical documentation around Wikibase but it's not enough. Loads of new user more require 1:1 consultation or face-face workshops and this is not easy to scale up.
