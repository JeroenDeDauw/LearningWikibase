# Learning Wikibase

[Wikibase](http://wikiba.se/) lets you store and manage structured, non-relational data in a central,
collaboratively managed repository. It is most prominently used to power [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/).

*LearningWikibase* is a project that collects and develops Learning Resources for using Wikibase.

## The problem

- Technical interaction with the Wikibase Software is challenging
- Wikibase is used very individual. Users have lots of different requirements, so there are a lot of different use cases
- Wikibase user can’t find enough developer support to get help in setting up a Wikibase Instance

This results in a small group of early adopter Wikibase enthusiasts getting a lot of requests by new users who like to set up and test the Wikibase software. The community around Wikibase already developed presentations and technical documentation, but many new users require one-to-one consultation or face-to-face workshops. Such a concept does not scale up.

## The solution

The project LearningWikibase aims at developing Learning Resources for Wikibase (including How To's, Screencasts, FAQs, one-click use cases etc.) based on community needs.
