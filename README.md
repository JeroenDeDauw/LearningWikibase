Welcome!
Thank you for joining Connecting-Wikibase. Wikibase (http://wikiba.se/) is the software behind Wikidata. Wikidata empowers Wikipedia and many other projects.
Both projects are technically developed by Wikimedia Deutschland e.V. (https://www.wikimedia.de/) and created and maintained by volunteers. 
The repro for Wikibase as software can be found here: https://github.com/wmde/wikibase-docker

<h1> What are we doing? </h1>
The problem:
<li> Technical Interaction with the Wikibase Software is challenging </li>
<li>Wikibase as a Wikibase Database is used very individual. User’s have lot of different requirements. So there are a lot of different use cases </li>
<li> Wikibase user can’t find enough developer support to get help in setting up a Wikibase Insance </li>

A small group of early adopter Wikibase-enthusiasts is getting a lot of request by new users, who like to set up and test the Wikibase software. The Community around Wikibase already developed presentations, technical documentation around Wikibase but lot's of new user more require 1:1 consultation or face-face workshops and this is not easy to scale up.

<h1> What is the solution? </h1>
The project Connecting Wikibase will develop a Mooc for Wikibase (e.g. Video, FAQ, One-click-Use Case) based on the Community needs. You can find my open canvas here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YFO84JXrA3J4MPsPVlONfgIFLrKqJo7wf-dQQtPQ8DY/edit#slide=id.g1b30ce0bb1_0_90

<h1> Whats about me? </h1>
I'm sandra and involved in open source for a couple of years and working as Project Manager for Wikimedia Deutschland e.V.. Here I'm participating in my volunteer role.

<h1> What is needed? </h1>
Community Input for creating a Mooc, Feedback of Content and Content Creators.

<h1> Contributors' guidelines </h1>
These are the contributing guidlines for the development of the this Learning Collection for Wikibase. The idea behind is that everyone can contribute their learning experience, hacks, tools etc with wikibase. The goal is to develop a FAQ, Learing Videos and well Documented Use cases so that it's easier for people to start and use wikibase. We will kickstart the project with some examples.

Invited experperts can created videos around their hacks, tools or further experience. The participation is open and everyone should be able to contribute as long as the person is sharing the open values described in this repro. The plattform to develop the Learning Collection will be this GitHub repro. Please use this also for Feedback and contributions.

This is a very early stage project and is crowdsourced and volunteer-let. We will focus on one introduction video, an FAQ to run it as pilot for testing and receiving feedback. Afterwards the content will be adapted and based on community feedback more videos etc. will be developed.

You can contact us or contribute via GitHubrepro.
If you have any questions please email us directly.

Getting started
We will need Learning Material for 5 sections:
*Installing Wikibase
*Developing a Datamodell
*Dataimport
*Dataexport and Visualisation 
*Maintanance

You can contribute your ressources for everytopic in the specific retro.
We will use Gitbook als Learning Collection Plattform (https://app.gitbook.com/@wikibase-learning-collection/s/wikibase-learning-collection/) for Wikibase and this Githup Repro to organize community acitivity and the work.
